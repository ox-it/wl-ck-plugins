# WebLearn CKEditor Plugins

Each CKEditor plugin has their own folder. Before installing a plugin, read the
README.md file provided in that plugin's folder.

Further documentation is provided at the [WebLearn CKEditor Plugin's
Documentation](http://ox-it.github.io/wl-ck-plugins/).

Plugins are compatible with CKEditor 4.3.2+.

## Testing

Each plugin can be tested by opening the `example.html` file in their folder.
The WebLearn plugins will only work in the Oxford WebLearn environment.
