  This plugin allows you to embed an image gallery for a specified folder
  in Resources that contains images.
<p>
  The titles and descriptions for each image are automatically pulled from
  Weblearn.

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Click on the Image Gallery icon.</p>
    <p><img src="images/image-gallery/show-icon.png"/></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      A dialog will appear with a dropdown allowing you to select from the sites
      available to you.
    </p>
    <p><img src="images/image-gallery/show-dialog.png"/></p>
    </p>
      Select the desired site and its Resources folder will
      be shown.
    </p>
    <p><img src="images/image-gallery/select-site.png"/></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Navigate through the folders by clicking on them to expand their contents

    <p>
      You are given several options for configuring the gallery:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Gallery ID</strong>:
          gives the images in the gallery an ID that you specify. This is mainly
          useful if you wish to embed multiple galleries that need to be
          distinguished from each other, and you wish to select a gallery using
          CSS or JavaScript.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Max Width/Height</strong>:
          automatically resizes the width/height of an image in the gallery to
          the dimension specified, maintaining the original aspect ratio.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Slideshow Speed (ms)</strong>:
          turns gallery into automatic slideshow when clicked, with the delay
          provided here in milliseconds. Leave empty to turn off slideshow mode.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click OK to embed the gallery.</p>
    <p><img src="images/image-gallery/embed.png"/></p>
  </li>
</ol>
