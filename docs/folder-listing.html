<p>
  This plugin allows you to embed a folder listing of a folder in the
  Weblearn Resources directory (from either Your Workspace or a site that you
  are a member of).
</p>
<p>
  Clicking on a file will open the file and clicking a folder will expand the
  folder tree to show its contents. Users cannot go higher up the folder
  hierarchy than the embedded folder.
